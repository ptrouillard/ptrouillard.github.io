## How to build a guitar from "scratch"

First of all, the purpose of this article is to describe an experimentation or rather multiple experimentations around the guitar build.
I will begin to write down basic steps & goals I want to achieve:

1. To gain experience in building solid body guitars and in guitar materials and wood technics in general
2. Achieve an old dream : Be able to build a real guitar, with a real sound
3. Be able to build guitars for others (It's a rather distant goal)


### What guitar ?
I want to build a solid body guitar, which is an achievable goal in my mind.
Building a solid body guitar means :
1. Build a body with a swoft piece of wood 40 cm (15") tick (the body needs to be light)
2. Build a neck with a hard piece of wood (maple wood)
3. Add the fittings and electronics parts (mics)
4. Paint the body and neck and polish

#### How to start ?
To get started, I choose not to build the neck myself. I add not encough knowledge on this for the moment.
I prefer to get some knowledge and experience on the body itself which is the main part, and the simpliest part to build with basics tooling.
Next, I choosed to build a basic model of guitar : The gibson SG Junior. 
Why ? 
Because this model is quite simple to build, electronics are very basic due to the single mic. 

The only tricky part of the build of this model is the presence of a workaround bridge that requires to create an angle between the neck and the body.
This problem is illustrated by the image below :

#### Get the neck
I bought a SG neck on leboncoin website. This is not an original neck from a gibson guitar.
This neck is build in maple wood.

#### Get the wood for the body
I bought 2 pieces of rectified wood on lebonsoin website.
The type of wood is poplar.
The two pieces perfectly fits together which is a very good point.
I put some wood glue on the two parts and put clamps to retain the pieces together during the sticking.
After 24 hours, I removed the clamps.

The tickness of a Gibson SG JR is about 35 mmm (1,3") and my piece of wood was previsouly created for a stratocaster guitar which body is about 42mm thick.
So, I used an electric planner to reduce the thickness.

The result was not perfect, and I not recommend this way of doing.
